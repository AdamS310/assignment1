	<h1>My IT Profile</h1>

	<p>I am 18 years old from Brisbane, Queensland. My parents were both born in Australia, but my father’s parents were Chinese immigrants. Even though my grandmother still speaks Cantonese, I only speak English. I finished year 12 last year and was to travel overseas but this was stopped by COVID-19 restrictions. This is the start of my university study. I enjoy gaming as a hobby and it’s also my work as a professional player. </p>

	<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>

	<!--Section 3-->
	<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

	<p>My interest in IT started over four years ago when I started gaming. A lot of my friends and teammates were IT professionals and I decided that it would be a good area for work in the future. My only experience is the IT subjects that I did at school. I chose RMIT because of its open entry policy for the Bachelor of Information Technology. The course is also online which appealed to me because it means that I can continue studying wherever I live.  I hope that the course will let me learn about all the different areas of IT and provide me with basic skills in these areas. I expect to learn about different networks, and their design and administration, software development, website design and security. I am also interested in using it as a base for further study in computer science or cyber-security. I hope that this will help me find an area I really enjoy working in and give me the skills to find work in this area. </p>

	<p>My ideal job lets me combine gaming with working in Information Technology, particularly in the area of security. It is something that I would have to work towar	ds because I might need to do some more study after graduation from this course. The position is with Electronic Arts Inc., which is a company that is well known for its games on all platforms. It involves looking for security risks and managing these so that the games meet the security standards of different regulatory bodies. A big part of the job is protecting the customers data. The job involves reviewing security of web applications, network infrastructure and client servers, and then explaining to teams how that affects the business. 
		The qualifications needed for the job are a Bachelor of Computer Science or Information Security, or equivalent experience. The skills needed include experience reviewing and understanding a range of programming languages and a knowledge of security assessment tools. It is also necessary to know different domains such as Networking, OS Terminals and Cloud Architecture, and risk management frameworks. Knowledge of cryptography and an exploitation technique is also necessary. General skills include presentation skills, good communication skills and professionalism.
		I don’t currently have many of these skills, but they are in areas I want to learn. The general skills (giving talks, interpersonal communication, and professionalism) are things that I’ve had to develop in my studies and gaming work. I am familiar with some of the EA games software and I have some basic knowledge and experience in a couple of the programming languages.  
	To work towards getting into a job like this, I need to finish my degree from RMIT. This will give me skills in software systems development and analysis. I would like to go on to do further study in computer science or look at majors in security and cloud computing. </p>

	<h1>Project Idea</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>
			 <a href="https://ea.gr8people.com/jobs/166142/junior-security-engineer?jobPipeline=Indeed"> Overview</a> - Online video-gaming is a multi-million dollar industry that is growing rapidly. With this growth, comes an increase in the number of cheats, which has negative connotations for both game developers and the people who play the game. While many games have built-in systems to find cheats, users continue to find it frustrating and often turn to social media to discuss the many players suspected of cheating. This project aims to develop an App that can be used by players to discuss and report suspected methods of cheating in multiple games.
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Motivation - Video-games are a lucrative growth market worldwide, especially in China and the United States. In 2020, the annual net revenue of Activision Blizzard (ATVI), one well-known gaming company, was US$2.78 billion, which was a 45% increase from the previous year (Clement, 2021). Even when developers invest a lot of money to develop anti-cheat methods, it remains a huge problem and is very frustrating for players. According to the ‘Global Gaming Survey’ by Irdeto, 88% or gamers reported that their games were affected by cheaters (Das, 2021). These cheats include coding to improve aim, stolen accounts, stolen in-game items, account boosting and introducing malware (Palmer, 2020). Currently there is lots of discussion about cheats on sites such as Twitter and Reddit, but there is no formal way to discuss cheats outside of in-game reporting. If the gaming community can actively report cheating, this will help collate information on cheating that can be used by both the players and the companies to identify problems. </p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Description - The name of the app is Cheat Catcher. It provides a community platform for gamers to report cheats and discuss cheating devices used in FPS games. 
					The first screen of the app will be to register and login. This will be done using an email address and 8-digit password. This will lead to the menu page which will give you several options:
					Registration and User Information 
					This page is where the user will register for the app. Information to be collected includes the user First and Last Name, Email Address, Contact Number, Address. The user will be asked for a Username. There will also be a place to Reset Password. The user will also be able to upload a picture / avatar for identification. 
					Reporting Page
					This page is where a User can report suspicious accounts using various games. It will include information on what game is involved, the identifier of the person being reported, the manner of cheating (dropdown box) and also a space for uploading clips of the game. It is important that the information being entered on this stage is successfully saved to make sure the data is valid and reliable.
					Blog / Chat 
					This page presents topics for discussion that can be added to by users. It is also possible to upload videos in this spot. It will be organised in either game order, type of cheat system, or general discussion. There would also be the ability for users to join groups based on interest, to allow them to develop an online community to support each other.
					Statistics
					This page would be organised by game and would give statistics about the number of people who have reported cheats and the numbers of each type of cheat reported. It would be linked to the data being inputted on the Reporting Page. 
					Developer Information
					The final screen will include information about the developer and a link for contacting them via email. 
				When designing the app it is important to work out the exact games that data will be collected about and make sure that information is in the description. Similar to social media sites, the app would need moderators to ensure that the information being entered is appropriate. </p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Tools and Techn	ologies To develop the App, a variety of equipment including both software and hardware is needed. This includes:

					<ul>
						<li>
							Software - MIT App Inventor
						</li>
						<li>
							Computer
						</li>
						<li>
							Device to test app.
						</li>
						<li>
							Cameera – to take pictures and record videos
						</li>
						<li>
						Microphone / Sound output for videos </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Skills Required - Many skills are needed for a project to be successful. Firenxe (2020) outlines some of these specialist skills, including project management, design, and digital engineers. The article shows how important it is to work as a team. For this project, there are a number of skills that are required. These include:
					Coding skills – Java or another language (or use of the MIT App Inventor) 
					Design skills to create an app that looks appealing.
					Skills to improve user interface and user experience (UI/UX)
					Communication skills, including writing skills to make sure the app makes sense and the questions say what you want them to say.
					Data management skills to make sure the data is collected and managed in the best way.
					Skills in cloud infrastructure to help manage the app.
					Skills in security and risk management to make sure that private information is protected.
					Working within a team environment is also important.
				</p>

			<p> OutCome - If the project is successful, it would provide a central platform for gamers to report cheats that they identify in games. It would produce a resource for both players and gaming companies that would complement current methods of reporting cheats in-game. It would also help to collect data about the methods of cheating, who is cheating, and how many gamers are affected by this. There are limitations that need to be considered. There are so many games it is necessary to pick a subgroup of games to focus on, for example, FPS games.
